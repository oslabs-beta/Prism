[0] If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:

[0] 	- install 'stream-browserify'
[0] If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:

[0] [1m[31mBREAKING CHANGE[39m[22m[1m: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
[0] This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.
[0] 
[0] If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
[0] 	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "stream": require.resolve("stream-browserify") }'
[0] 	- install 'stream-browserify'
[0] If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
[0] 	resolve.fallback: { "stream": false }[39m[22m
