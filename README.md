# Introducing Prism!

Prism is a Kubernetes and Docker visualizer that helps users understand the status of and relationships between their nodes, pods, services, and containers. It will help developers quickly view their server status and identify problem areas with live metrics and pod health statistics.
Our goal for this project was to provide the best possible user experience while minimizing the code a user has to write (everything launches with a single command).

## Getting Started
### Requirements

- [ ] Running cluster in Kubernetes/ Minikube
- [ ] The following ports must be free: 
  - [ ] 8080  ( where the application will be located)
  - [ ] 3333  (used by the backend of the application)
  - [ ] 3000 (used by Grafana)
### Steps : 
- [ ] Fork and clone into the repository
- [ ] Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
  - [ ] Your MongoDB URI (key `MONGO_URI`) OR: 
  - [ ] A client ID and secret for Github Oauth: keys `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`
- [ ] Execute the startup shell script (run `./startup.zsh`) - this will:
  - [ ] Install necessary dependencies for the web application  
  - [ ] Install Prometheus üî• and Grafana üìä onto your cluster with our custom configuration
  - [ ] Start up the web application 

- [ ] Go to `http://localhost:8080` and view metrics to your heart's desire ü§©
