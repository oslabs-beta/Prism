# A Presumptive Thank You
We're so excited that you're thinking about contributing to our application! We built this thinking of the many great directions in which it could go and are very grateful to those who would take it upon themselves to help. 

# Possible Directions for Future Work 

## State management

## Customizable dashboards ( positioning, resizing ) 
It would make for an even better UI if users were able to freely resize and move dashboards in a way that would save in state (possibly persist through the database). 

## Inter-Cluster Views

## Test Coverage
The current level of test coverage is very limited to route unit tests and a few key react components. 
Room for improvement includes: 
- [ ] Unit testing for middleware controllers
- [ ] Route testing could be updated to include token authentication 
- [ ] State management integration testing
